## Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

Many factors that affect how much you pay for health insurance are not within your control. Nonetheless, it's good to have an understanding of what they are. Here are some factors that affect how much health insurance premiums cost:

Age: age of primary beneficiary

Sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

Children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

Smoker: Smoking

Region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest
